      My career goal is to attend trade school “Detroit School of Digital
      Technology” and get a job as a graphic/website designer and move out of
      Detroit.In 5 years from now I see myself out of Detroit Traveling the
      world? I will get there by Saving up my money and Doing better to school
      as well as by attending different Coding bootcamps.
